# Session: Expand dotfiles philosophy and plan work setup

## Goal

Enhance `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with clearer philosophy on "why" this repo exists and create a concrete TODO plan for tomorrow's work setup (universal skills + enterprise shim repo).

## Context

### Starting State
- **Current situation**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` existed with good technical content but lacked clear articulation of the broader vision
- **Problem/need**: Need to document the philosophy around AI-augmented ephemeral development environments and plan specific work items for tomorrow
- **Prior attempts**: File had been created previously but focused more on technical details than strategic vision

### Environment
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Tools**: git, GitHub CLI
- **Files involved**: 
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
  - `docs/TODO.md`

## Conversation Log

### 03:56 - Initial request and exploration

**Discussion**:
User requested analysis of codebase to create/improve `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Explored repo structure and found file already existed with comprehensive content.

**Decision**:
Rather than replace, make surgical improvements to keep philosophy intact while fixing stale information and adding missing sections.

**Action**:
- Read existing copilot-instructions.md, README.md, install.sh, CI workflow, tests
- Checked for other AI config files (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, etc.) - none found
- Analyzed existing agent/skill structure

**Outcome**:
Complete understanding of repo architecture and existing documentation quality.

### 04:15 - Philosophy expansion

**Discussion**:
User wanted to flesh out the "why" behind the repo and its purpose in their broader development ecosystem. Discussed:
- Ephemeral cloud-based development workflow
- Agentic workflows with Copilot agents/skills
- Work setup with cookiecutter repos and Makefile patterns
- Personal vs enterprise dotfiles separation

**Key insight**: User described modern development bottleneck as **context, not compute**. The repo exists to deliver rich, tailored context instantly when spinning up new workspaces.

**Decision**:
Add comprehensive "Why This Exists" section that captures:
1. The 5-step workflow (clone → auto-install → agents available → generate workspace-specific → productive work)
2. The broader ecosystem (personal baseline + enterprise shim + instant onboarding)
3. The vision (extensible AI-augmented development anywhere)

**Action**:
Added "Why This Exists" section to copilot-instructions.md with workflow, ecosystem, and vision subsections.

**Outcome**:
Clear articulation of philosophy that will guide future decisions and help agents understand the "why" behind design choices.

---

### 04:19 - Tomorrow's work planning

**Discussion**:
User needs specific priorities for tomorrow when cloning dotfiles to work machines:
- Universal skills for rote work delegation (PR generation, TDD bug fixing, git worktree, context management)
- Work-specific context building skills (internal docs, MCP servers, Codespaces setup)
- Enterprise shim repo structure
- CI with work Codespace images

**Decision**:
Create "Tomorrow: Work Setup" section in `docs/TODO.md` with three clear subsections:
1. Universal Skills (personal dotfiles)
2. Enterprise Shim Repo Setup (work)
3. Validation checklist

**Action**:
Added comprehensive TODO section with 4 universal skills, 4 enterprise components (shim structure, enterprise skills, CI, MCP configs), and 5 validation items.

**Outcome**:
Clear roadmap for tomorrow's work with concrete deliverables.

### 04:20 - Surgical improvements to instructions

**Discussion**:
User correctly pushed back on my attempt to dramatically simplify the file, emphasizing that the philosophy is valuable context for agents making decisions in this repo.

**Decision**:
Keep all philosophy intact, only make surgical improvements:
- Add Commands section (test/lint/CI)
- Add CI Pipeline description
- Add install.sh execution flow details
- Add symlink strategy details
- Fix stale Project Structure
- Remove "REMOVED" section (no longer useful)
- Point to docs/TODO.md instead of duplicating priorities

**Action**:
Made 6 targeted edits to copilot-instructions.md, preserving philosophy while adding missing technical details.

**Outcome**:
File now has both strong philosophy ("why") and practical commands ("how").

---

### 04:39 - Commit and push

**Discussion**:
Review changes before committing.

**Decision**:
Commit with descriptive message capturing both philosophy expansion and TODO creation.

**Action**:
```bash
git add .github/copilot-instructions.md docs/TODO.md
git commit -m "Expand philosophy and add Tomorrow work plan..."
git push
```

**Outcome**:
Changes successfully pushed to main branch (commit 18ad964).

---

### 04:46 - Session log creation

**Discussion**:
User requested session log to capture this work.

**Decision**:
Use session-log skill to create structured log following the template.

**Action**:
Creating this session log file.

**Outcome**:
Session documented for future reference.

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: Surgical improvements vs full rewrite
- **Question**: How much to change the existing copilot-instructions.md?
- **Options**: 
  1. Full rewrite focusing only on commands/architecture
  2. Surgical improvements keeping philosophy
- **Choice**: Surgical improvements
- **Rationale**: User emphasized philosophy is essential for agents making decisions; it documents intent and purpose, not just technical details
- **Trade-offs**: File is longer but captures complete context

### Decision 2: Tomorrow's priorities
- **Question**: What should be ready for work tomorrow?
- **Options**: 
  1. Focus on agent generator first
  2. Build universal skills first
  3. Set up enterprise shim first
- **Choice**: Universal skills → enterprise shim structure → validation
- **Rationale**: User hasn't found custom prompts valuable yet; skills enable generic agents first, then specialize. Work MCP servers integration is critical.
- **Trade-offs**: Agent generator delayed but foundation is stronger

### Decision 3: Where to document TODO
- **Question**: Keep TODO in copilot-instructions.md or separate file?
- **Options**:
  1. In copilot-instructions.md
  2. In docs/TODO.md
- **Choice**: docs/TODO.md (already existed)
- **Rationale**: Keeps instructions focused on principles/architecture, TODO is a living document that changes frequently
- **Trade-offs**: Two files to maintain but clearer separation of concerns

## Artifacts Created

- [x] `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Enhanced with philosophy and practical details
- [x] `docs/TODO.md` - Added "Tomorrow: Work Setup" section
- [x] `.github/sessions/2026-02-09T04-46-51Z.md` - This session log
- [x] Git commit `18ad964` - Changes pushed to main

## Next Steps

- [ ] Tomorrow: Implement universal skills (PR generation, TDD bug fixing, git worktree, context management)
- [ ] Tomorrow: Create enterprise shim repo structure
- [ ] Tomorrow: Set up enterprise-specific skills with work MCP server integration
- [ ] Tomorrow: Configure CI with internal Codespaces images
- [ ] Future: Consider implementing agent generator after skills prove valuable

## References

- Commit: `18ad964` - "Expand philosophy and add Tomorrow work plan"
- Previous session: `2026-02-08T23-39-00Z.md` (if exists)
- Related files:

  - `docs/TODO.md` (updated)
  - `.github/skills/session-log/SKILL.md` (used for this log)

## Summary

Enhanced dotfiles copilot-instructions.md with clear philosophy articulating why the repo exists (context is the bottleneck, not compute) and how it fits into AI-augmented ephemeral development workflow. Created concrete TODO plan for tomorrow's work setup focusing on universal skills first, then enterprise shim repo structure with work MCP server integration.
