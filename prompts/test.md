# Test

Focus on Docker + Makefile usage.

Provide:
- The recommended `make` target(s) to run tests.
- If running tests inside Docker, show the `docker compose exec <service> make test` pattern.
- If no tests exist, suggest a lightweight check (lint, format, or build).

Be explicit about expected output or success criteria.
