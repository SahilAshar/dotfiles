# Plan

You are assisting in a Docker + Makefile workflow. Produce a concise, ordered plan that assumes:
- The project is run inside Docker (compose or devcontainer).
- Commands should prefer `make <target>` when available.

Include:
1. Discovery steps (files/commands to check).
2. Implementation steps (touching the minimal set of files).
3. Validation steps (tests or `make` targets).

Keep the plan short and actionable.
